#Define a function called anti_vowel that takes one string, text, as input and returns the text with all of the vowels removed.

def anti_vowel(text):
    for c in text:
        if c in 'aeiouAEIOU': #if a letter in the text is a vowel...
            text = text.replace(c, '') #then replace that letter with nothing (ie delete that letter)
    return text

#this exercise was ridiculous
# anti_vowel("Hey You!") should return "Hy Y!".
